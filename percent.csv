In the mid 70's, Acconci created audiovisual installations that turned exhibition spaces into community meeting places, and in the 80's he invited viewers to create artwork by activating machinery that erected shelters and signs. He also turned to the creation of furniture and to prototypes of houses and gardens in the late 80's.

Only eight feet wide, the narrow vestibule connects both the past and the present; the old and new worlds within the school facility. Working within the restricted dimensions of this space, I began to think of my designs on the floor as a map or form of signage that would direct the traveler to other destinations. As an artist whose personal work investigates themes of memory and history, the project began to take on a special meaning for me; evolving into a visual metaphor for passage and discovery. Linking separate spaces suggested imagined voyages: the immigrant's journey; the explorer's trade route; a river; a beach; a treasure hunt evoking childhood memories of growing up in New York. In creating the brass designs, I was mindful of the academic setting and took care to select images that would represent different areas of learning, but ultimately, I wanted to retain a feeling of playfulness. Arranging the artwork in the form of a game would encourage students to enjoy the process of looking at, and moving through, the newly designed spaces of their school. I wanted the floor to be a playground and a site for unearthing possibilities. The goal of the game I created would be to discover the objects and find the unexpected in unexpected places; to match the etched glass and brass images, and to consider how things look as they were created in different mediums. - Arai," 1997"""," ""tarai-a.jpg"""," """""," """""," """""," """""," """""," ""12""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scott Burton's refurbishment of the Sheepshead Bay Fishing Piers provides modern amenities while maintaining the historic character of the seventy-year-old piers. Burton framed the entry to each pier with lights and a perforated steel bench. At the end of each pier, the artist constructed a wooden ottoman and a second perforated steel bench to provide a quiet space to enjoy the water traffic and the view. The ottomans also serve as bases for 34 foot (10.4 m) high poles that fly wind-vanes shaped into colorful numbers to identify each pier. The wind-vanes are visible from Emmons Avenue and the elevated roadway of the Shore Parkway," three blocks away.

As a model for the school children from diverse ethnic groups, the oceans and seas replace nations and continents, therefore transforming state borders into fluid linguistic, cultural and social heritages to be commonly shared.

Words such as \""Absence","\"" \""Drifting","\"" \""Imagination","\"" \""Temporal","\"" and \""Without Language\"" reflect the state of initial displacement and vulnerability that we may experience in the process of adjusting to a new reality. A small sequence in the blue mass represents the movement of a character named Not-a-Superhero", floating in and flying swiftly above the wave.

His work for the Queens Hospital Center consists of two series entitled Breath and Mandala. The Breath series features a bird motif that flows left and right and the Mandala series utilizes a variety of symbols related to ideas of healing", power, and spirituality. The work is executed on clear glass and mirrors using serigraphs as well as combinations of lightly etched and deep carving sand blasting. The pieces were designed for multiple spaces throughout the building: the fa�ade, the interior lobby, windows, four elevator lobbies, and a glass protective barrier above the escalator. The format and basis for this project revolved around the concept of nature and the emblematic woman as an icon for protection and care. The Mandala series utilizes a 28 member ancient matrix, known for medicine wheels and calendar systems based on phases of the moon, emphasizing the significance of time in an ever-changing, yet nurturing, environment. Several other symbols such as the tree of life (a source of nourishment), a triangle or dragon's eye (a protective symbol), and the sign of Venus (a biological allusion to femininity) are an integral part of the design. The series of four glass mandalas were created for the elevator lobbies on the second through fifth floors. Other central images in the design are the triquetra and the mandorla.

Out of the Corner of My Eye incorporates imagery drawn from nature, technology, and my imagination. I wanted to create a visual environment that was abstract but at the same time suggestive of things in the world.  Like an enormous drawing, the work presents episodic and mutating imagery echoing the meandering quality of the viewer's movement and mind as he or she traverses the space.  My hope was to create an environment that immersed the viewer on both micro and macro levels.Out of the Corner of My Eye has no beginning and no end.  For me, its sense of endlessness mirrors the non-linear nature of education. I wanted to emphasize, in abstract language, how education is an ongoing process, which continues throughout a person's life. And how, like making art, it is associative in nature.  In my previous pieces, I have been concerned with the inner workings of the mind: the impulse to play, to invent, and to change.  These same impulses are central to this work. I am particularly concerned with systems and patterns that possess an almost labyrinthine-like complexity. For example, the visual display of quantitative information.

For the building", the artist designed and hand-painted thirteen ceramic medallions representing the historic activity of Washington Market. She also designed a steel fence that portrays a dynamic procession of silhouetted ships gallantly parading around the schoolyard. As stated in The New York Times," \""The rolling horizontalness of the fence seems to provide a human anchor for the World Trade Center behind it. And in the way a tugboat drags a tanker toward a school gate like a mother dragging her reluctant child"," there is wit as well.\"" The fence captures the vitality of the City's shipping industry", and is based on actual vessels that cruised New York Harbor. The ships, from an 18th-century ketch to a 20th-century barge, from as nearby as New Jersey and as far away as China, offer a glimpse into Washington Market's prosperous past and a hopeful vision of the future of lower Manhattan.

Richard Dattner, the architect for the school, had designated the fence and the medallions for artwork. I had never designed a fence or medallions before. Interestingly, the designs took me back to my beginnings as a painter and away from the sculptor I had become. Coming up with my idea, the ships and the market, was fun. Beyond that, I found working on P.S. 234 to be extremely frustrating. Not only did it take nearly two years of letter writing and phone calls (the School Construction Authority was not yet formed) before I had a contract, and longer before I received the first payment, but I also found even the studio aspects of the commission to be only minimally satisfying. Given the review process, safety concerns, and the need for the full scale work to cleave closely to the proposal drawings, the process of discovery and change that means everything to me as an artist was absent.I do believe in public art. I believe in art that can become a part of daily life, art that creates a sense of place and community. And while it will always be crucial for me to make my installations, my 'real' art, I have found creating public art to be, in its own way, a gratifying and worthwhile endeavor despite the difficulties and compromises. -- Dennis," 1997"""," ""ddennis.jpg"""," ""ddennis-a.jpg"""," ""ddennis-b.jpg"""," ""ddennis-c.jpg"""," ""ddennis-d.jpg"""," """""," ""79""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early experiments in flight were not only beautiful and whimsical, but also a testimony to the human imagination, exemplifying the courage and ability to dream and learn.

Born 42866", Dermansky committed herself to being an artist at an early age. Raised in Englewood, NJ, her earliest inspiration comes from the Cloisters and the Natural History Museum in New York City. She graduated from TulaneNewcomb University with a concentration in ceramics and sculpture and was awarded the Watson Fellowship, which enabled her to travel for a year and visit monumental and architectural sculptures. On her return to New York City, Dermansky worked in the East Village before attending graduate school out west. However, New York City called her back. Dermansky lived and worked for ten years in a storefront studio on Elizabeth Street. There she worked on many large scale sculpture projects including a 100 foot long fence on East 12th Street and began showing her work both nationally and internationally. Requiring more space," Dermansky has since relocated upstate. At the same time she launched a Web site jsdart.com so people would still have access to her work. The Percent for Art Program was her first public art commission."""," ""\""I have always had the tendency to work large. Public art is the perfect venue for an artist with the desire to work in a large scale while at the same time allowing for the most interaction with the artwork and viewers as possible", so I found it a natural path to pursue. After visiting Gaudi's Gwell Park in Barcelona, I dreamed of adding something to the world that would inspire others, as his work had me. So much of the modern landscape is bland. Often I see the inside of tunnels as blank canvases waiting to be painted, and plain buildings as structures to be covered with sculptures. Creating work for a specific audience to enhance and stimulate their day to day experience is very satisfying to me, in ways the work I make in my studio for myself does not. Working on a large scale, for the public," is a way for me to give something back to the community and enhance the environment for those who come after me.\"" -- Julie Dermansky"," 2001"""," ""jdermansky-a.jpg"""," ""jdermansky-b.jpg"""," ""jdermansky-c.jpg"""," ""jdermansky-d.jpg"""," ""jdermansky-e.jpg"""," """""," ""81""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1980", with the inheritance he received after the death of his father in his senior year of high school, he bought a 35mm camera. After leaving high school, he lived in Puerto Rico for a year. Learning how to use a camera provided him with an avenue to explore his native culture and history. In 1981, he attended Empire State College, where he began formalized training in photojournalism, and received a degree in 1985. During his college years, he began to develop some socio-political views that profoundly affected his photography. Several projects were generated directly from those views, including Ser Puertorriqueno, an extensive exploration of racism in New York City. He was also able to freelance for various publications," including the Village Voice and the New York Times. Ricky Flores is currently a staff photographer for Gannett Suburban Newspapers."""," ""The Percent for Art commission allowed me to consolidate previous work into a cohesive direction providing a platform to produce additional work for the final installation at M.S.P.S. 206. At the time of the commission", I was one of the first Puerto Ricans to receive one, and one of the first to be granted under the newly formed School Construction Authority. The primary challenge was to integrate work of a highly volatile nature, such as racism in New York City, with the day-to-day life in a positive framework. The commission gave me the time and the leeway to consolidate all the various views that I had developed and focus them for a specific purpose, which was the completion of the License to Dream project in the M.S.P.S. project. I think what I achieved with the License to Dream project located children in history and more importantly, the importance of their role in creating it. Various images in the show illustrate that, such as children welcoming Nelson Mandela to New York City, or the peaceful student demonstration held in New York after the Rodney King verdict.

Elsewhere, the sculpture includes letters spelling out dozens of names-geniuses in their fields-drawn from a variety of cultures and historical epochs, and viewers examining the undersides of the wings will decipher a quote by Walt Whitman.  The subject matter is simultaneously: pastoral-depicting an elegant movement of avian activity; scientific-relating to the activities within the building; and philosophical-a meditation on the nature of esthetic and technological pursuits.

Covering the walls of the entrance to the new Bronx Library Center", the piece was created using the latest scientific technology to image the genetic expression of a single individual. The glass and steel wall relief sculpture is composed of approximately 3,000 three-inch diameter colored glass cylinders, which are cut in various lengths and mounted on perforated metal backing. The pattern and palette of the installation was determined by Microarray (DNA sampling method). The Microarray samples include seven colors: black, red, orange, yellow, dark green, green, and light green. The variation in the depth of the glass cylinders coupled with the random patterning of the Microarray presents the information as a topographical landscape, presenting the scientific information in an accurate, yet abstract manner.

Rollins conducted a series of intense and rigorous workshops with the six students, focussing on creating designs for the three large paintings in the lobby. As The Odyssey chronicles Odysseus' arduous journey home, Rollins asked each student to draw the wings that would have the power to return them home. They also designed an abstract painting of the Shield of Achilles, the mythological shield that protects Achilles from his own rage and suggests with its shape a large eye, the form of eternity and the ancient map of the cosmos. Tim Rollins + KOS then composed, enlarged, and painted the designs of the Spofford residents onto a ground of actual book pages torn from copies of The Odyssey and glued onto stretched linen. In addition to the lobby paintings, a major sculpture in bronze was designed for the inner courtyard at Horizon. The two identical figures, dressed in contemporary street clothes and reading a large book, represent Achilles and Odysseus. Two quotes are written on the page, one spoken to Achilles by Athena, the other a self-reflection by Odysseus. The sculpture suggests, like Homer, that the self-destructive, uncontrolled rage of Achilles and the capacity for self-redemption possessed by Odysseus are the two parts of every human personality, constantly in conflict and in need of concern, compassion," and love.

For this expansive site, Sasaki developed the themes of space and time as expressed through sea imagery and motion. Beginning at the Aquarium entrance, the artist introduces familiar fish shapes in three-dimensions that appear to be swimming within the concrete and gradually becoming more shadowy beneath the broadening wave patterns. They are followed by increasingly abstract geometric shapes -- capsules, zygotes, inverted cones -- representing the vortex of the waves and egg-like forms that recall more basic forms of life in transformation. As one walks along the wall, the forms become abstract, as if to show the primordial development of ocean life. The relief was cast by the contractors in twenty-six sections, and additional elements, such as egg, shell, and fin shapes, were executed in terrazzo and ceramic and attached to the wall after fabrication.

Wave Wall in Green is an arts project which functions on three levels. First, it is a sculpture that is a symbol of the relationship between water, life, and the life of our planet. Directly influenced by the function of this site, I felt very strongly that the content of this environmental work should relate to the important role that this plant performs: the cleaning and protection of our water and environment.  Second, this art piece forms the perimeter of the Coney Island Water Treatment Plant. As the perimeter of the plant, Wave Wall in Green, serves the important function of security. It is made up of gates and fences ranging from 10 to 25 feet in height, which control access to the building as well as keep the building free from graffiti. Third, Wave Wall in Green was designed to soften and landscape this industrial complex situated in a residential area. The problems of a large sewage treatment plant in a residential area are obvious. This design uses lower cost, industrial chain link fence, but at the same time, disguises it through form and planting. The fence, where visible, always takes on the narrative image of water. Otherwise, plants obscure the fence as natural landscaping, islands or vine covered water forms. The idea is that if the observer drives, walks, or lives in front of the sewage treatment plant, he will see green: growing trees, bushes, grasses, flowers, and vines.  Wave Wall in Green is made in two sections. On the west side of Knapp Street, the imagery represents waves, water, and islands; on the east side, land, shoreline or coast. The wave along Knapp Street undulates from a three dimensional curl to a two dimensional wall and back to three dimensions. Behind Knapp Street, on Voorhies Avenue and Avenue Y, the fence is two dimensional with a curving top alluding to the water's surface.  Particular attention has been paid to the back of the complex on Voorhies Avenue and Avenue Y by planting sweet smelling and flowering shrubs and trees. On residential Avenue Y especially, beds of flowering bushes and trees have been used to screen and naturalize this side of the site. All plants have been chosen and placed to insure no maintenance. The purpose is to achieve as natural a setting as possible. No pruning or tending is planned, but rather, a natural romantic quality insured by choosing hardy specimens and designing all dimensions to accommodate mature plants. From the trellis-like cantilevered wave, to grassy shoreline, to islands and sea, Wave Wall in Green is a living environment and picture - a growing green mantel wrapped around the Coney Island Water Pollution Control Plant. It protects and gives meaning to the complex, while serving as a buffer between this invaluable industrial mechanism and the surrounding population. -- Smyth," 1989"""," ""Ned Smyth", who graduated in 1970 with a B.A. and high honors in art from Kenyon College in Ohio, is no stranger to public art.

In a conversation with Principal Getz, early in the planning stages of this new school building, he mentioned his teaching philosophy, which is to approach learning through the process of problem solving. So rather than beginning with known answers, his students begin with a real life question, from there they gather information about the subject�what is known and �how we know what we know.� This is curiosity-based problem solving rather than rote learning (memorization). It is at the heart of the work I've made for the Lobby of MS114. On a long wall I've installed what looks to be bright glass stripes of color that add a textural shift to the ceramic stripes on the surrounding walls of the lobby. As students pass through that area they may notice that there is a large shard of light filtering through trees and illuminating the panel.Since the lobby is the place that the students wait for their parents to pick them up, I imagine at some point they may realize that the light and shadow never shift � that it remains constant. Further, they may notice that there is no giant window or garden in the direction of the light. As students of natural science, that may be their first inkling that the �light' is something that needs investigation. On further inspection the students will discover clues that help them parse out the truth. The title of the piece tells them that the direction of the light is from the Northeast, which again, they've learned is not a natural path for the sun's rotation through any of the earth's seasons. And at some point they will come to realize that the image of lights and shadow is a permanent artwork that mimics natural phenomena. As students spend a few of their middle childhood years here, living with this artwork, I hope they'll muse about some of the more philosophical aspects of the piece. They may begin to understand that being able to stop time (the light never falters or shifts) is a very human longing and something we may wish for all our hearts, like Peter Pan, but that time continues to move and we change with it.

Her profound connection to the urban Latino population whose themes and concerns have been her primary inspiration as an artist, as well as her love of teaching, particularly of young people, have strengthened her throughout. Tufino's first mural commission, for El Museo del Barrio in 1973," was a proud affirmation of the Afro-Caribbean roots of the Puerto Rican people. She has also completed a mural at the 103rd Street Subway Station for the MTA Arts for Transit Program."""," ""As an artist", if I take my brushes and my skills and I invest in the lives of young people, then others can see what is possible.

The three forms", which appear alongside one another in different postures, appeal to imaginative readings: depending on where one stands, they appear angelic, look like nautical disco balls or give the impression of an Egyptian ankh. Ward began his research by making weekly visits to the docks and by taking walking tours with Manhattanville expert Eric K. Washington.  In the process, he learned about its attenuated commercial and transportation history, from its pre-colonial importance in the economic lives of Native Peoples, to the effects of mid-nineteenth-century industrialization in the extension of the Hudson River Railroad.The open-ended sculptures are accompanied by a series of street-sign-inspired text.  To create the signage that line the tree-planted pathway on three-foot highway barriers, Ward distributed a survey to a group of community members to list words that evoked sounds of the home they remember from their pasts, to which he added the nonexistent names of buildings and streets which were a part of the area.  According to the artist, the iridescence of the white-on-green porcelain enamel and the stainless steel sculptures suggest a furtive and engaging take on the idea of landmark, as well as comment on the subjective nature of vision; opening up timely questions about shared experiences," loss and memory.
